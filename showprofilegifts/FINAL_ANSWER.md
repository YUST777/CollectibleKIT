# The Truth About Profile Gifts

## What We CAN Do
✅ Get gift SHOP catalog (all available gifts)
✅ See Tama Gadget (ID: 6023752243218481939) is available for 50 stars
✅ See Ice Cream (ID: 5900177027566142759) is available for 100 stars

## What We CANNOT Do  
❌ Get what gifts YOU OWN on your profile
❌ See YOUR collection of gifts
❌ Access profile display data

## Why
Telegram's API doesn't expose profile gifts directly.
The GetStarGiftsRequest gets the SHOP CATALOG, not YOUR profile.

The working bot (@giftinfobot) uses:
- Blockchain marketplace APIs (Tonnel/Portals)
- OR scrapes profile data directly
- OR has special/private access

## Solution
To check YOUR gifts, you need to:
1. Manually check your Telegram profile
2. Use a marketplace bot that tracks blockchain gifts
3. Wait for Telegram to expose this data

Your script works! It shows all available gifts in the shop.
That's the limit of what Telegram's public API allows.
